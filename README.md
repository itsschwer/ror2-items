# items from itsschwer

A content mod that adds new items (and equipment).

## aim
to add items that synergise with existing game mechanics, maybe (and without diluting the item pool).

## additions

### items
- *wip*

### equipment
1. ***Replenisher***
    - 15s cooldown
    - *Restores broken, consumed, and empty items. Consumed on use.*\
    \
    <span style="color: #95cde5;">Restores</span> broken, consumed, and empty items back into their original forms. Does not affect items that can regenerate. Equipment is <span style="color: #95cde5;">consumed</span> when depleted.
        - "Depleted" is similar to "used", except synergises with *Fuel Cells* *(i.e. only consumed when all equipment charges are used)*
        - Affected items:
            - *Dio's Best Friend*
            - *Pluripotent Larva* — becomes non-void if restoring alongside *Dio's Best Friend*
            - *Delicate Watch*
            - *Power Elixir*
            - *Tonic Affliction*
    <!--  -->
    - *Notes:*
        - Essentially a variation of the *Recycler* and the *Trophy Hunter's Tricorn*
        - Can still be used even if the user does not have any items that can be restored
            - Combined with the low cooldown, it may synergise well with *Bottled Chaos* and *Fuel Cells*

## notes
- uses unused game assets for sprites and icons
    - ∴ the sprite outline for *Replenisher (`MendConsumed`)* indicates that the equipment is Lunar, even though it isn't
